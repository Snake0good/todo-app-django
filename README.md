# Optimizations

There are a few things that can be optimized. Here are a few I know. 
- The database. Right now, it's only an SQLite3 database and needs to be buffed up
- It's simple. Optimizations would be to add for features. Create topics, splits, time goals, etc..

# What Did I Learn?

- class structure instead of function components
- generic.edit views
- standard mixins
